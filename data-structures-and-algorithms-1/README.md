## 2. Recursion 

### What is recursion?
_it's a way to solving a problem by having a function calling itself_
- making the problem smaller so it is easier to compute
- we need to provide a base condition so the recursion will run until the base condition is satisfied otherwise the recursion will run indefinitely
